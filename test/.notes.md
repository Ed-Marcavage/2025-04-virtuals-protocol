- Cast identification
    - use ^ this to determine order of deployes? Via contract/interface inheritant and type casting? 
    - until we hit code (uni) inherited but not defined in code base = mock
- Whats set in the initalizer?
    - issue if instance = Clones.clone(daoImplementation);

- check if _disableInitializers() in constructor
- Start writing slither helper scrips to expidate this and rapid trial/error
- called_x[0x] addr


- Algo to determin deployment order, can we just use it to see which
contract includes the most other contracts (coverage) and only deploy that one and then prune the rest, 
    - issue is agent factory already deploys token, but the algo would have deeped the token needed to come first?

- contracts deployed via nother contracts? Dont need to init, if not
we need to init, can we look at byte code?
